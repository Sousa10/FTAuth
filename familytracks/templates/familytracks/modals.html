                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                CSS CORE VALUES:
                <br><br>
                SERVICE & CUSTOMER ORIENTATION: Incredibly easy to do business with. Simple straight
                forward pricing and service offerings. Being service-minded or customer-oriented means that
                we care about providing a quality experience to the clients we serve. This value extends to
                supporting our community and our associates. Valuing service means that we aim to provide a
                meaningful experience to the people we serve and support.<br><br>
                INTEGRITY: Valuing integrity in the workplace means that we strive to do the right thing,
                even when we know no one else is looking. CSS highly values honesty, transparency and a
                commitment to doing what is best for our clients, teammates, and company. The growth of a
                company follows the professional growth of its employees. Valuing growth
                means that we have the drive to continuously improve both ourselves and our company. Growth
                is based on mutual success. CSS is a company that develops its staff and provides an
                environment that fosters personal and professional development.<br><br>
                ACCOUNTABILITY: Is a willingness to accept and embrace responsibility for one's actions
                and the impact on the enterprise.<br><br>
                INNOVATION: Challenging ourselves to see what is possible to better meet the needs of
                fellow associates, clients and company. CSS will always be a work in progress, striving to
                improve and do better, thinking of creative ways to solve tough problems and take calculated
                risks. Finding new ways to solve a problem can help the company move forward.<br><br>
                CREATIVITY AND TENACITY: The un-relenting use of our creative or original ideas, particularly
                in the creation of high-value software solutions and professional services for our clients.

                <br><br>
                The internet lacks a Free, complete solution for individuals and families that addresses common needs, including: Family Finances, a secure Social Media Solution, a unified Calendar and Meeting application, a List and simple Project Management system, and a comprehensive Fitness and Sports application.
                <br><br>
                TRAXX has been designed and developed to fill this gap and pulls it all together in one place with a simple, secure system which includes a simple intuitive User Interface that is accessible via a PC, or hand-held mobile device.
                Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have tole me, ‘A faster horse!’.  The TRAXX mission is to read things that are not yet on the page and respond with an incredible offering.
                <br><br>
                There are 37 advertising spots in the TRAXX Application Suite – Images along left & right page margins.  
                “Clicking” on a sponsor’s advertising image opens a formatted text box with plenty of room for Ad copy, contact information, promotion code, specials, hot-links, etc.  Sponsors may match advertising spots with target market interests depending on the page they are presented on. And, we offer an “Early Adopter” prior to member count.  Sponsors can easily see visits and “clicks” which will only increase as we reach critical mass.
                And, we will never charge member users any type of subscription or usage fee and will never sell or share member data with any organization.
                <br><br>
                TRAXX is incredibly easy to do business with and responsive.  We solicit feedback on an on-going basis and will personally respond to inquiries and feedback.  Our Board of Advisors as well as Executive leadership has broad experience as entrepreneurs and in leadership and building a business.  We are a non-bureaucratic, agile organization able to react quickly to threats and opportunities.
                We have low overhead costs allowing us to invest aggressively in TRAXX.  Decisions are made quickly without layers of management.
                <br><br>
                Please feel free to contact me directly (704) 607-4291, if I can answer any questions you may have or provide additional details.
                <br><br>
