                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    CSS CORE VALUES:
                    <br><br>
                    SERVICE & CUSTOMER ORIENTATION: Incredibly easy to do business with. Simple straight
                    forward pricing and service offerings. Being service-minded or customer-oriented means that
                    we care about providing a quality experience to the clients we serve. This value extends to
                    supporting our community and our associates. Valuing service means that we aim to provide a
                    meaningful experience to the people we serve and support.<br><br>
                    INTEGRITY: Valuing integrity in the workplace means that we strive to do the right thing,
                    even when we know no one else is looking. CSS highly values honesty, transparency and a
                    commitment to doing what is best for our clients, teammates, and company. The growth of a
                    company follows the professional growth of its employees. Valuing growth
                    means that we have the drive to continuously improve both ourselves and our company. Growth
                    is based on mutual success. CSS is a company that develops its staff and provides an
                    environment that fosters personal and professional development.<br><br>
                    ACCOUNTABILITY: Is a willingness to accept and embrace responsibility for one's actions
                    and the impact on the enterprise.<br><br>
                    INNOVATION: Challenging ourselves to see what is possible to better meet the needs of
                    fellow associates, clients and company. CSS will always be a work in progress, striving to
                    improve and do better, thinking of creative ways to solve tough problems and take calculated
                    risks. Finding new ways to solve a problem can help the company move forward.<br><br>
                    CREATIVITY AND TENACITY: The un-relenting use of our creative or original ideas, particularly
                    in the creation of high-value software solutions and professional services for our clients.
