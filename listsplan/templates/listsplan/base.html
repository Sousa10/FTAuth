                    The Lists & Planning application serves multiple purposes.  Like all TRAXX applications 
                    Lists & Planning may be easily run on a hand-held device such as a mobile phone.  It is 
                    a trivial matter to create and maintain simple lists such as a Grocery List, Chores, 
                    To-Do's, book lists, journaling and random notes.  Lists may be shared with family members and a single list, may have multiple 
                    authors, or contributors.<br><br>
                    Lists & Planning also supports simple project planning, with defined predecessor/successor 
                    relationships and is perfect for planning vacations, business planning, and personal 
                    development plans.  Planning fully supports the SMART goal method, 
                    where you apply specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound objectives 
                    to help you reach your goals and track progress.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    CSS CORE VALUES:
                    <br><br>
                    SERVICE & CUSTOMER ORIENTATION:  Incredibly easy to do business with. Simple straight 
                    forward pricing and service offerings. Being service-minded or customer-oriented means that 
                    we care about providing a quality experience to the clients we serve. This value extends to 
                    supporting our community and our associates. Valuing service means that we aim to provide a 
                    meaningful experience to the people we serve and support.<br><br>  
                    INTEGRITY:  Valuing integrity in the workplace means that we strive to do the right thing, 
                    even when we know no one else is looking. CSS highly values honesty, transparency and a 
                    commitment to doing what is best for our clients, teammates, and company.  The growth of a 
                    company follows the professional growth of its employees.  Valuing growth 
                    means that we have the drive to continuously improve both ourselves and our company. Growth 
                    is based on mutual success.  CSS is a company that develops its staff and provides an 
                    environment that fosters personal and professional development.<br><br>
                    ACCOUNTABILITY:  Is a willingness to accept and embrace responsibility for one's actions 
                    and the impact on the enterprise.<br><br>
                    INNOVATION:  Challenging ourselves to see what is possible to better meet the needs of 
                    fellow associates, clients and company. CSS will always be a work in progress, striving to 
                    improve and do better, thinking of creative ways to solve tough problems and take calculated 
                    risks. Finding new ways to solve a problem can help the company move forward.<br><br>
                    CREATIVITY AND TENACITY:  The un-relenting use of our creative or original ideas, particularly 
                    in the creation of high-value software solutions and professional services for our clients.

                    <br><br>
                    The internet lacks a Free, complete solution for individuals and families that addresses common needs, including: Family Finances, a secure Social Media Solution, a unified Calendar and Meeting application, a List and simple Project Management system, and a comprehensive Fitness and Sports application.
                    <br><br>
                    TRAXX has been designed and developed to fill this gap and pulls it all together in one place with a simple, secure system which includes a simple intuitive User Interface that is accessible via a PC, or hand-held mobile device.
                    Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have tole me, ‘A faster horse!’.  The TRAXX mission is to read things that are not yet on the page and respond with an incredible offering.
                    <br><br>
                    There are 37 advertising spots in the TRAXX Application Suite – Images along left & right page margins.  
                    “Clicking” on a sponsor’s advertising image opens a formatted text box with plenty of room for Ad copy, contact information, promotion code, specials, hot-links, etc.  Sponsors may match advertising spots with target market interests depending on the page they are presented on. And, we offer an “Early Adopter” prior to member count.  Sponsors can easily see visits and “clicks” which will only increase as we reach critical mass.
                    And, we will never charge member users any type of subscription or usage fee and will never sell or share member data with any organization.
                    <br><br>
                    TRAXX is incredibly easy to do business with and responsive.  We solicit feedback on an on-going basis and will personally respond to inquiries and feedback.  Our Board of Advisors as well as Executive leadership has broad experience as entrepreneurs and in leadership and building a business.  We are a non-bureaucratic, agile organization able to react quickly to threats and opportunities.
                    We have low overhead costs allowing us to invest aggressively in TRAXX.  Decisions are made quickly without layers of management.
                    <br><br>
                    Please feel free to contact me directly (704) 607-4291, if I can answer any questions you may have or provide additional details.

                BENEFITS OF USING LISTS<br>
                1. Externalizing what we need to remember.
                <br>
                Lists are useful because they document what we ordinarily forget. Memory strongly prefers internal structure, and without this structure, remembering is hard work. Unlike stories—in which events are connected by cause and effect—items on a list have no internal structure, except verticality. The first item on a list does not cause the second. A series needs to be written—otherwise, we will forget what’s on it.
                <br><br>
                2. Remembering across contexts.
                <br>
                When we retrieve a memory, it is often retrieved in context. Without the right context, we have difficulty remembering. That’s why people can forget why they came into a room—the initial encoding context was in a different room. Lists provide an effective, context-free method for remembering.
                <br><br>
                3. Resonating with our serial processing.
                <br>
                We naturally take things one at a time. What feels like parallel processing is often sequential, with several tasks performed one at a time quickly. The linear layout of a list is friendly to our serial processing.
                <br><br>
                4. Adding without restructuring.
                <br>
                We can amend a list by simply adding to it. A list is not an outline that requires rearrangement with each additional item. (If we want a carefully ordered sequence, we can simply renumber and then reorder.)
                <br><br>
                5. Generating new items.
                <br>
                While creating a list, a new item can act as a retrieval cue for another item. Each new item on a list can encourage memory for another important item.
                <br><br>
                6. Concision.
                <br>
                Lists convey a lot of information in relatively few words. Lists are concise and orderly distillations—small and digestible, like tapas.            </div>
